Instead of teaching the model to output only the final answer, we train on (question, rationale, answer) so the model learns to internalize multi-step reasoning patterns. A practical recipe is STaR (Self-Taught Reasoner), which uses a stronger teacher model to bootstrap rationales that a smaller student can learn from.\n",
